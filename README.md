# zulu-dataset
This is a diggital assistant that uses a dataset with zulu and english 
the dataset is in the farming field. the set is manauly made by me. with the help of same farmer ( the one I used to get the farming based questions and answers from ) 
the data set is a json file so be careful when choose the tool you are going to use when editing it I would recommend visual studio 2019
